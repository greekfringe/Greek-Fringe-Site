  Jorge Sotirios grew up in a country town in Australia and worked in his father’s milk bar whilst attending a French-based high school. He acquired his Masters in Journalism integrating his undergraduate studies in Political Economics, Philosophy & French. After editing (R)EVOLUTION magazine in the nineties, he wrote extensively for the print, radio and stage media, whilst organising events that dealt with Hellenism at the crossroads of Latin, Asian and Antipodean cultures. Writing for ATHENS NEWS he journeyed to areas as diverse as Mount Athos, Istanbul and Paris. His books include LONESOME GEORGE, C’EST MOI! which drew on his wild travels through the Amazon basin and Galápagos Islands, and GRAFFITI OVER MARBLE, focusing on the Greek crisis not only from an economic perspective but more importantly on the social and psychological ones.
