  Elsa Mouratidou was born and raised in Thessaloniki, Greece. She started her music studies at the Contemporary Conservatory of Thessaloniki and joined Ayia Triada Children’s Choir as a child, which had a great impact on her future career. She also studied Greek literature at the University of Thrace. Elsa continued her studies in phonetics, with Eleni Mihalopoulou, attending several seminars (with Spyros Sakkas, free vocal improvisation with Savina Yannatou, chorus (χορός) in ancient Greek drama with Michael Marmarinos and more). 
  
  She is one of the founding members of the a cappella band STRINGLESS (world folk music in a polyphonic mode). Her parental roots go back to the Caucasus mountains. This is the cord that links her with the music of the Black Sea. She is the lead vocalist of ARGATIA ENSEMBLE (Pontian, Armenian, Turkish, Laz, Georgian folk music). Her love for the Celtic tradition lead her to the band TIR FADA where she is the lead vocalist, singing Irish and Scottish tunes. Always searching for new inspiration, she takes part in various projects like MAROUVA (Cretan folk music), ‘Απ’ τα κουμπάκια ανάμεσα’ TRIO (tango, fado, rebetiko and more). She took part in theatre productions as a singer, as well as a vocal coach for the National Theatre of Northern Greece, and other venues. She has been working as a performer for 24 years and as a vocal coach for the last 16.
