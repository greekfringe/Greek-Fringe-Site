description: |
  Luka Lesson is a poet and rapper whose work engages with the Greek mythology of his family homeland, the fiercely political and the vulnerably self-reflective. Luka has performed with the Queensland Symphony Orchestra, released his own musical albums and books, and has been published in a number international poetry collections. Luka has toured with poets such as Shane Koyczan (Canada) and Omar Musa (AUS), with musicians such as Akala (UK) and Nahko (USA), and with thinkers such as Dr Cornel West (USA) and Xiuhtezcatl Martinez (USA). Luka Lesson has always used education-based programs as a means for social change both within Australia and abroad, and his work is currently being studied in English departments across the country. Luka Lesson also runs his own poetry retreat in his grandfather’s village on the island of Rhodes, Greece every year. Academically, Luka holds a Masters of Sound Design (in Performance Poetry) from the Victorian College of the Arts as well as an undergraduate degree in Anthropology and a First Class Honours in Indigenous Studies from Monash University. Luka’s latest solo work, entitled Agapi & Other Kinds of Love will premiere in 2020.
